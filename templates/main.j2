            <p>Our software development agency has been approached by a local businessman by the name of Mickey; he owns We  ❤️   Loan Sharking. Mickey likes to run a clean business, and his enforcers help him achieve this goal.  He is a loan shark, an unofficial bank of sorts, and has requested our services in developing a tracking system for the charitable personal loan service he provides to the impoverished community who are unable to obtain funding through more reputable financial channels.  His business has recently expanded and now has in excess of 100 million dollars spread across nearly 1000 loans to businesses in the community, and he wants to be compensated ON TIME for his generosity.  The problem is there are now too many ventures to keep track of at this point. He employs a couple dozen enforcers, who are each in charge of ensuring that their assigned clients, numbering almost 500 in total, are prompt in upholding their obligations by visiting the hundreds of locations scattered throughout the city. The website we are tasked with designing will be used to track transactions between his enforcers and clients in order to make sure no money goes missing for the sake of all parties involved.
