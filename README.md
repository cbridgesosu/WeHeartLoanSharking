# WeHeartLoanSharking 

A humorous project built for a database systems course, featuring a web-based administrative frontend for managing a fictional loan sharking operation.

This application demonstrates core relational database concepts through a CRUD interface that interacts with a custom SQL backend. While the theme is tongue-in-cheek, the project showcases practical skills in schema design, SQL querying, and full-stack integration.
